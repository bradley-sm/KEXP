# KEXP

A Mac OS command line script to stream [KEXP](https://www.kexp.org) via iTunes.

This may just be the most useful line of code I have ever written.

### 1. Install

* Download the `kexp` file to a directory that is in your `$PATH`. I like `~/bin` personally.
* `chmod +x` that bad boy.

### 2. Start streaming

`$ kexp`

### 3. Rawk On 

🤟🏼

### 4. Support KEXP
